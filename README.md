# Atom ESLint

Lint your JavaScript files in Atom with ESLint. **Disclaimer**: This is very alpha software.

If you're not familiar, [ESLint](http://eslint.org) is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript. Be sure to check out the [plethora of rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules) that ESLint has available.

## Installation

```bash
apm install eslint
```

## Usage

`ctrl-alt-e` will lint the current file and display the errors in a list. Selecting an error will take you to that error's location.
